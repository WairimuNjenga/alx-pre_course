My first readme
A README file is an essential guide that gives other developers a detailed description of your GitHub project and makes it easier to follow through when readind about the project.
 here are key reasons to help convince you that it’s a good idea:

A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.
It’s the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.
The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from bad ones.
Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!
